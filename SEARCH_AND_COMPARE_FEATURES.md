# Search and Compare Features Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the PDF Library with comprehensive search and comparison functionality across all project management standards with book-grouped results.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Homepage** (`/`)
- **Books Display**: Grid of all available books
- **Single "Compare" Button**: Large prominent button that takes you to the Compare tab
- **No Search Bar**: Search functionality is only available in the Compare tab
- **Clean Interface**: Focus on browsing books or going to compare

### 2. **Compare Page** (`/compare/`)
- **Search Bar at Top**: Full search functionality to find topics across all books
- **Recommended Topics Section**:
  - Topics grouped by book (each book gets its own section)
  - Gradient header showing book name and topic count
  - Up to 6 curated topics per book
  - Topics related to: project, risk, stakeholder, scope, quality, planning
  - Green color scheme to differentiate from search results
- **Book Sections**: Each book's topics are displayed in a separate section with a header

### 3. **Search Results** (`/search/?q=<query>`)
- **Book-Grouped Results**: Topics from the same book appear together in one section
- **Book Section Headers**: Each book has a gradient header showing:
  - Book title
  - Number of matching topics
- **Topic Cards Display**:
  - Section number (if available)
  - Topic title
  - Page range and level
- **No Book Name on Cards**: Book name is in the section header instead
- **Smart Navigation**: Returns to Compare tab or Search results as appropriate

### 4. **Topic Search Functionality**
- **Subset Matching**: Searching "project" returns ALL topics containing "project"
- **Searches**: Section titles and section numbers
- **Clickable Results**: Each topic card opens the full section content
- **Grouped by Book**: All topics from same book are grouped together
- **Ordered**: Books are alphabetically ordered

### 5. **Navigation Improvements**
- **Context-Aware Back Buttons**:
  - From Compare page → Returns to Compare
  - From Search results → Returns to Search results (preserves query)
  - From Book detail → Returns to Book TOC
- **Preserved Context**: URL parameters maintain navigation context
- **Previous/Next Buttons**: Maintain the "from" parameter for proper return navigation

### 4. **UI/UX Enhancements**
- **Consistent design theme**: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) across all pages
- **Hover effects**: Cards lift on hover with shadow effects
- **Responsive grid**: Auto-adjusts based on screen size
- **Color coding**:
  - Search results: Purple theme
  - Compare/Recommended: Green theme (#16a085 to #27ae60)
- **Professional typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper spacing

## URL Structure
- `/` - Homepage with books and search
- `/search/?q=<query>` - Search results for topic query
- `/search/?q=<query>&from=compare` - Search from compare page
- `/compare/` - Compare page with recommended topics
- `/section/<id>/?from=compare` - Section detail from compare
- `/section/<id>/?from=search&q=<query>` - Section detail from search
- `/book/<id>/` - Book table of contents

## User Flow Examples

3. Sees all topics containing "project" across all books

4. Can search for specific topics using search bar
5. Clicks a recommended topic → Opens section content
6. Clicks "Back to Compare" → Returns to compare page

### Example 3: Cross-Book Topic Exploration

## Technical Implementation

### Views Updated (`library/views.py`)
```python
def search_topics(request):
    # Search sections by title or section_number
    # Returns all matching sections across all books

def compare_topic(request):
    # Shows recommended topics from multiple categories
    # 12 curated topics from different domains
```

### Templates Created/Updated
1. `search_results.html` - New search results page
2. `compare.html` - Updated with search bar and recommended topics
3. `section_detail.html` - Smart back navigation based on context
4. `index.html` - Updated search form and Compare button

### URL Routing
- Added `/search/` endpoint for topic search
- Updated `/compare/` for recommended topics
- All URLs use GET parameters for context preservation
